    <h2>Some Things About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hello class! My name is Sam Rogers and I grew up in New Jersey, went to college in Washington, DC, lived in New York City for 8 years, and moved to Portland, OR in the beginning of 2017.</p>
    <p>Why you ask? Well, I love to play outside! Camping, rock climbing, skiing (resort our touring), mountaineering, biking, hiking...you name it, I LOVE to do it. And where better to play outside than Portland!</p>
    <p>I currently work at Wieden+Kennedy where I manage the Digital Media investments for Old Spice. I don't really enjoy the strategy world and am much better at critical thinking and problem solving, so here I am, working to change my career and solidify my technical skills!</p>
